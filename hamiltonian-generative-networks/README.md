# [Re] Hamiltonian Generative Networks
Re-implementation of [Hamiltonian Generative Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13789).
Learning Hamiltonian dynamics from videos of simulated phisical environments.
We provide the first open-source implementation, reproduce the experiments, perform additional experiments
on more complicated phyisical environments and propose a baseline model.

The report was accepted for publication in [Re Science C](http://rescience.github.io/) at the [2020 ML Reproducibility Challenge](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020).
Waiting for publication, here is the [OpenReview page of the report](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Zszk4rXgesL).
