# Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
*Carles Balsells Rodas, Oleguer Canal, Nuria Marzo, Federico Taschin*

This work further develops on the Lawrence et al. papers [1] and [2]. We first replicate the algorithm and evaluate it on the same datasets as the original author. In addition, we apply it to new data and provide a more extensive assessment of its performance against similar methods such as PCA and Kernel PCA.

The original formulation of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) can be regarded as an extension of the Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) introduced by Tipping and Bishop [3] some years earlier. Thus, the GPLVM consists on the introduction of the kernel trick intuition in this probabilistic reformulation of PCA, that leads to a decomposition of the data represented in higher dimensional spaces.
