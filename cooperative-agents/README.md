*Doumitrou Daniil Nimara, Federico Taschin*

**Abstract** Intricate tasks set in complex environments often benefit greatly from thecooperation of multiple agents.  In such a setting,  each agent can act independently from the rest, but chooses to exchange information and team up inorder to optimize his performance on the given task.  In this report, we willfocus on five characteristic problems set in cooperative environments, whichspan numerous applications.  We will examine Short and Long Range MultiAgent Search,  the Vehicle Routing Problem,  Formation Sweep and ShooterCoordination.  The methods described in this paper can be utilized to planautomatic patrols, ensure fast, robust area scanning and coordinate an intri-cate ordering-delivery system.
